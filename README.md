# Data-Manipulation-in-Excel
An example of several manipulations in Excel spreadsheets that can be useful for those who plan to use it. I have separated each type of approach into parts so that you can choose the piece of code that best helps you.

#Observations

1. The names of files and worksheets are fictitious, the logic is that you understand what each step of the code does to use that part that best meets your needs, as there are several different processes in this code, maybe one of you will like it.

2. You can notice that throughout the code I changed the way I worked, at first I used dataframes and in the second time I used xlsx files, this because I faced several errors, because to carry out certain manipulations in excel, it is necessary to use openpyxl with the function load_workbook, which does not accept dataframes, so that's why I kept switching the way I work.

3. There are more practical ways to do what I did, but as I was in a hurry to use this automation, I couldn't refactor the code to make it more efficient and less embarrassing, but as soon as I have time I'll do it, the important thing for me is that it works and this way was the fastest I found to get around the errors.

4. Use the part of the code that best suits you, as I said before, I have several data manipulations in Excel that we often don't find out there.
